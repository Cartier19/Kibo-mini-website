# Kibo-mini-website
This project is an extract from the kibo website. Your task is to embed different multimedia contents in this website and use your knowledge of layout to arrange the elements appropriately.

After completing the instructions, your website should look like this:

## Starter Code
We've provided starter code which contains the content of the website and the default style. Included files are

index.html: content of the website, including comments on where you should add your own code
style.css: Colors and font styles for the page. You'll have to add the layout and positioning.
Note: The colors and fonts are already styled. Focus on fixing the layout!

## Instructions
Before starting, run the code to see the current state of the website. Read through index.html to see the initial contents.

# Part 1: Add multimedia content
First, you'll add the logo, videos, and map to index.html where the comments suggest.

Add the kibo logo using the provided kibo-logo.svg file in the images folder.

# Part 2: Styling
Arrange the elements in the header using flexbox:
arrange the elements in a row
add space around the elements

They should be centered along both vertical and horizontal axis.
The should wrap when the screen width is too small
In the "Visit Us" text to the center of the page, put the h2 and iframe into a flexbox:

It should be a column
It should center the text and map
